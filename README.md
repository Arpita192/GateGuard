GateGuard: A Secure Hostel Management System
A full-stack MERN application designed to digitize and streamline the student leave pass process, featuring role-based access control and QR code verification for enhanced security and efficiency.

üöÄ The Problem It Solves
Traditional hostel management often relies on manual, paper-based systems for tracking student leave, which can be inefficient, prone to errors, and insecure. GateGuard addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, digital platform that automates the entire leave pass lifecycle, from application and approval to secure verification.

‚ú® Key Features
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A secure authentication system with distinct dashboards and permissions for different user roles:

Super Admin: Manages all user accounts and oversees the entire system.

Student: Can apply for leave passes and view their pass history and status.

Warden: Can approve or reject leave pass requests from students.

Clerk: Manages student records and assists with administrative tasks.

Security: Verifies students entering or leaving the premises by scanning QR codes.

Digital Leave Pass System: A seamless workflow for students to submit leave pass requests. Wardens receive notifications and can approve or reject requests with a single click.

QR Code Verification: Upon approval, a unique, tamper-proof QR code is generated for each leave pass. Security personnel can scan this code using a dedicated scanner interface to instantly verify the pass details and log the student's entry or exit.

Centralized Management: Provides a single source of truth for student information, leave history, and user roles, eliminating paperwork and improving record-keeping.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed

A running instance of MySQL

Git

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://your-repository-url/GateGuard.git
cd GateGuard

2. Backend Setup
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install NPM packages
npm install

# Create a .env file in the backend folder and add your environment variables:
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=gateguard
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

# Start the backend server
npm start

3. Frontend Setup
# Navigate to the frontend folder from the root directory
cd frontend

# Install NPM packages
npm install

# Start the React development server
# The "proxy" in package.json will automatically route API requests to the backend.
npm start

üöÄ Usage
Once both servers are running:

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:5000

The frontend React app will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000

You can register a new user or log in with the Super Admin account to begin managing the system.
